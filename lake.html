<p>Lakes are bodies of water surrounded by land, formed through natural processes like
    tectonic activity, glacial movement, or volcanic eruptions. They can be freshwater 
    or saline, depending on the water sources feeding into them. Lakes play a crucial 
    role in local ecosystems, providing habitat for a variety of plant and animal 
    species, and serve as important water sources for humans, agriculture, and 
    recreation. The water in lakes can be still or exhibit movement due to wind, 
    currents, or inflow from rivers or streams. Many lakes, whether large like the 
    Great Lakes or small and secluded, are treasured for their beauty and tranquility, 
    offering opportunities for fishing, boating, and sightseeing.</p>
